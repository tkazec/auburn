A beautiful, speedy, fully customizable, tile-based new tab page for Chrome.

Todo:

* Improve responsiveness
	* Currently scales based on the viewport width. If easily possible to implement, should dynamically choose which (viewport width or height) to factor.
	* Possibly with min()/max() if and when they get added to Chrome?
	* Vertically center when vw/vh start working in calc().
* Use dataset and attr() in calc() for the x/y/width/height when they all work together in Chrome.
